# Neovim Notes
Do you want to try [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) editor on? Great!
Do you use [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) or another OS from its family? Excellent!
This is a guide to set it up quickly and have a ready-to-play installation with a bunch of awesome plugins.

Here Neovim is supposed to be used in a terminal with [True Color](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728) support: before starting with the guide, check to have one (i.e. gnome-terminal >= 3.12.3).

Have fun!

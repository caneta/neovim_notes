# Neovim Notes

Do you want to try [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) editor? Great! Do you use [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) or another OS from its family? Excellent!!!

This is a guide to set Neovim up quickly with a bunch of awesome plugins:

- [How Tos](./howto)
  1. [Installation on Ubuntu](./howto/01_NvimInstall.md)
  2. [Configuration](./howto/02_NvimBasicConf.md)
  3. [Plugin installation](./howto/03_NvimPlugins.md)
- [Tip and tricks](./tips)
  1. [General tips](./tips/01_NvimGeneralTips.md)
  2. [Plugin tips](./tips/02_NvimPluginTips.md)
- [Configuration files](./conf)

Some side note:

- Neovim is configured to be used in a terminal with [True Color](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728) support: before start, check to have one (i.e. gnome-terminal >= 3.12.3)
- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is used as plugin manager
- my configuration and plugin choice reflect my web-development needs, but I think is a good starting point
- I've tried to keep things simple: [modular config files](https://www.gregjs.com/vim/2016/do-yourself-a-favor-and-modularize-your-vimrc-init-vim/)

Any suggestion or help to improve this guides are really welcome!

Enjoy!

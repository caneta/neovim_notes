# Neovim basic configuration
* Copy [config dir files](./../conf)  inside *~/.config/nvim/* directory
* Look at file comments: almost each line have a description of what it does
* The main configuration file for Neovim is *~/.config/nvim/init.vim*
* To avoid startup errors, before starting nvim, follow the [Plugin setup guide](../howto/03_NvimPlugins.md)
